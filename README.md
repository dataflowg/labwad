# LABWAD
Please see [Sylvain-Deposit's repo](https://github.com/Sylvain-Deposit/LabWad) for the current version of LABWAD.

This is a LabVIEW implementation for loading Doom format WAD files, based on the [original LABWAD version](https://forums.ni.com/t5/Example-Programs/LABWAD-LLB-to-open-WAD-files-from-Doom-amp-Doom2/ta-p/3994533) by \_Sylvain on the LabVIEW Code Exchange.

This version adds a number of modifications:
* Improved load times
* Replaced all IMAQ functions with the LabVIEW Picture functions (NI Vision is no longer required)
* Replaced LLB with a project
* Added some [PSX Doom Fire](https://github.com/dataflowg/labview-psx-doom-fire)!
